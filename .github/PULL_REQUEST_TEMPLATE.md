**Is the solution complete?**

Yes

**Did you run into any problems?**

One problem I had was in the very beginning making the "cookie store" center in the image. I tried adding an image tag and us positioning to make the div center on top, but it didn't work. What I did to fix this was to use `background-img` tag on the `header` and made the `header` `display:flex`. This made it so the `div` would center on top of the background image.

Another problem of mine is changing the cookie images for `alternating.html`. Any changes I made to the style would not make the image smaller or bigger. What I did to fix this problem is using bootstrap's `w-25` to the image. This changed the image's size. But another problem came up when the screen size is changed to a smaller screen. The image would not be centered. I fixed this by using media query and making `display: block` and `margin-auto`. This made it so the cookie's image are centered.

**Did you collaborate with others on this solution?**

No
